I'm an engineer turned physicist currently working at the intesection of `chaos theory` and `machine learning`. <br/>

Currently, I'm a `postdoctoral fellow` at the Nonlinear Artificial Intelligence Laboratory <br/>
at North Carolina State University.

If you would like to know more about my research, please check-out my `Research Projects` page.

When I'm not working, I watch(mostly) and play pc games(e-sports).
