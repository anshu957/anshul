I'm an engineer turned physicist currently working on problems in theoretical ecology using concepts and ideas from network theory <br/>
and dynamical systems theory.

Currently, I'm a `postdoctoral fellow` at the  Institute for <br/>
Chemistry and Biology of the Marine Environment~(ICBM), <br/> University of Oldenburg, Germany.

If you would like to know more about my research, please check-out my `Research Projects` page.

When I'm not working, I watch(mostly) and play pc games(e-sports).
