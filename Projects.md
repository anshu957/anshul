        In this project, we investigate how the communities with only certain
        specific trait structure could support <font color="red"> supersaturation</font>, a phenomena where multiple species co-exist on less resources which is commonly known as <font color="blue"> paradox of plankton</font>. We use an established chemotaxis model developed by [<a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs12080-014-0228-6.pdf">Dutta et al. (2014)</a>], in which a community consists of 'N' species and 'k' resources (k<<N) represented by (N+k) first order ordinary differential equations. This model supports <font color="red"> supersaturation</font> for some specific values of species traits. However, it does not explain what is so special about such trait values and their relationship with each other. Our approach is to randomly generate trait values which support <font color="red"> supersaturation</font> through a gradient search algorithm and finally finding structures inside thus generated random communities through various machine learning algorithms. Our prilimary findings suggests emergence of clusters in the trait space which might offer some explanation and support in niche-seperation theory.

  <label for="collapsible2" class="lbl-toggle">First observation of an unexpected and intriguing kind of phase synchronization between coupled non-identical oscillators</label>
  <div class="collapsible-content">

      <p>
      The emergence of spontaneous order in a system of multiple interacting agents
       without the presence of focal point of control is one of the most
ubiquitous and crucial phenomenon that pervades all nature. This order (populary known in dynamical systems community as <font color="red"> <b>synchronization</b></font>) among elements enables a system to perform a vast range of collective tasks such as generation of rhythm in a heart pacemaker and synchronous spiking of neurons in the brain.
    This projects focuses on an <font color="blue">accidental discovery</font> of a new kind of order in which weakly coupled units are in phase synchrony with each other while the strongly interacting (coupled) ones remains de-sychronized. This non-trivial state could have several interesting implications. One immediate problem that we can think of is the detection of weak/strong links (interactions) in a network of multiple units based upon their spatio-temporal behavior.
