        In this project, we investigate how the communities with certain
        specific trait structure could support <font color="green" supersaturation></font>, a phenomena where multiple species co-exist on limited shared resources which is commonly known as <font color="blue" paradox of plankton". We approach this problem using a chemotaxis model developed by Dutta et al., which represents
