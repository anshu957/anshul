        In this project, we investigate how the communities with only certain
        specific trait structure could support <font color="red"> supersaturation</font>, a phenomena where multiple species co-exist on less resources which is commonly known as <font color="blue"> paradox of plankton</font>. We use an established chemotaxis model developed by [<a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs12080-014-0228-6.pdf">Dutta et al. (2014)</a>], in which a community consists of 'N' species and 'k' resources (k<<N) represented by (N+k) first order ordinary differential equations. This model supports <font color="red"> supersaturation</font> for some specific values of species traits. However, it does not explain what is so special about such trait values and their relationship with each other. Our approach is to randomly generate trait values which support <font color="red"> supersaturation</font> through a gradient search algorithm and finally finding structures inside thus generated random communities through various machine learning algorithms. Our prilimary findings suggests emergence of clusters in the trait space which might offer some explanation and support in niche-seperation theory.
