Welcome to my webpage!
I'm an engineer turned physicist currently working on problems in theoretical ecology using concepts and ideas from network theory and dynamical systems theory.
If you would like to know more about my research, please check-out my `projects` page.

When I'm not working, I watch(mostly) and play pc games(e-sports).
