Metacommunity models describe ecological systems consisting of several patches
or habitats in which several populations interact with each other as competitors or via predator-prey relationships in form of food webs. These meta-communities are interconnected by migration corridors. Competition among species for resources is in most ecological models determined only by one limiting resource. We study metacommunities in which multiple resource limitation is taken into account leading to non-equilibrium coexistence of species. For a multi-species community, supersaturation is a state of coexistence, where the number of species competing for resources exceeds the number of limiting resources. In this work, we study the interplay between the resource conditions in the patches and the dispersal strength. Specifically, we analyze to what extent dispersal across the patches, can support global supersaturation in a multi-patch system, where nutrient conditions in some of the patches does not support supersaturation. Our principle result states that global supersaturation
can be achieved in an optimal window of dispersal strength. Further, we report that the emergent dynamical behavior of the system which corresponds to this optimal window, allows resources to be shared optimally across all the patches.
